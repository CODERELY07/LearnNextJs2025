Two types of Components in Next.js
Server Components
Next.js treats all components as server components by default
It perform server-side tasks like reading files or fetching data directly from a database
The trade-off is that they can't use React hooks or handle user interactions

Client Components
add 'use client' directive at the top of the component so you make it client component
while client component can't perform server side task like reading files, they can use hooks and handle user interactions
Traditional React components
